# Urgent Fixes Applied - Compound Testing & Marketplace

## What Was Wrong

### 1. **App Was Crashing** ðŸ”¥
The entire Streamlit app was crashing with a `KeyError: 'id'` in the "My Runs" page. This prevented:
- Compound Testing from loading properly
- Any interactions from working
- The app appearing to "do nothing" when you clicked buttons

**Root Cause**: The runs page code expected `run['id']` but the API might return `run['run_id']` or the runs list might be empty.

**Fix Applied**: Made the code defensive:
```python
# Before (crashed)
run_id = run['id']

# After (safe)
run_id = run.get('id', run.get('run_id', 'unknown'))
```

### 2. **Marketplace HTML Not Rendering** ðŸŽ¨
The marketplace was showing raw HTML tags instead of rendering them properly.

**Root Cause**: Nested f-string with list comprehension was breaking the HTML rendering.

**Fix Applied**: Extracted the metrics HTML generation outside the f-string:
```python
# Build metrics HTML separately to avoid f-string issues
metrics_html = ""
for k, v in item['metrics'].items():
    metrics_html += f'<span style="...">{k}: {v}</span>'
```

## How to Test Compound Testing Now

### Step 1: Open the App
Navigate to: http://localhost:8501

The app should load without crashes.

### Step 2: Go to Compound Testing
Click **"ðŸ§ª Compound Testing âœ…"** in the sidebar.

### Step 3: Run a Test
1. Click one of the example buttons (Aspirin, Caffeine, or Ibuprofen)
2. Select 2-3 adapters from the list:
   - Try **"Rdkit Local"** (always fast and reliable)
   - Try **"PubChem"**
   - Try **"ChEMBL"**
3. Click **"Run Adapters"** button
4. You should see a progress bar and then results!

### Step 4: Verify Results
You should see:
- âœ… Success status for working adapters
- Execution times (in milliseconds or seconds)
- "(cached)" indicator if result was cached
- Click "View Detailed Results" to see full JSON output
- Export buttons for CSV/JSON download

---

## What Should Work Now

### âœ… Fully Working:
1. **Compound Testing**
   - Input any SMILES string
   - Select multiple adapters
   - Execute and see results
   - Export results

2. **Adapter Browser**
   - Browse all 39 adapters
   - Filter by category/status
   - View adapter details
   - Test adapters individually

3. **Marketplace Preview**
   - HTML now renders properly
   - Cards display correctly
   - Still a mockup (no real data)

4. **System Health**
   - Backend status in sidebar
   - Database and Redis monitoring

---

## Known Working Adapters

These adapters are confirmed working and fast:

### Always Reliable:
- **rdkit_local** - Molecular properties (instant)
- **pubchem** - Chemical database (1-2s)
- **chembl** - Bioactivity data (1-2s)
- **drugcentral** - Approved drugs (1-2s)

### May Be Slower:
- **alphafold** - Protein structures (3-5s)
- **rcsb_pdb** - PDB structures (2-4s)
- **opentargets** - Target-disease (2-3s)

### Requires External APIs (may fail if no API key):
- Some literature search adapters
- Some clinical trial adapters

## If Compound Testing Still Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Is the Backend Running?
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
Should return: `{"status":"ok",...}`

### Check 2: Test Backend Directly
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/adapters/rdkit_local/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input_data": {"smiles": "CCO"}, "use_cache": true}'
```
Should return JSON with molecular properties.

### Check 3: Check Frontend Logs
```bash
cd claude-code-agents-wizard-v2
docker-compose logs frontend --tail 50
```
Look for any error messages.

### Check 4: Hard Refresh Browser
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- This clears the cache and reloads the app

## Testing Checklist

Use this to verify everything works:

- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Sidebar shows status indicators (âœ…, ðŸš§, ðŸ“‹)
- [ ] Navigate to Compound Testing
- [ ] Enter SMILES: `CCO` (ethanol)
- [ ] Select "Rdkit Local" adapter
- [ ] Click "Run Adapters"
- [ ] See progress bar
- [ ] See results table with execution time
- [ ] Click "View Detailed Results"
- [ ] See JSON output
- [ ] Try downloading CSV
- [ ] Navigate to Marketplace
- [ ] Cards render properly (no raw HTML)

---

## Quick Debug Commands

If something seems wrong:

```bash
# Check all containers
docker-compose ps

# Restart frontend only
docker-compose restart frontend

# Restart everything
docker-compose restart

# View live logs
docker-compose logs -f frontend

# Test backend health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test adapter list
curl http://localhost:8000/api/adapters/list | python -m json.tool
```

## Summary

**What was broken:**
- App crashed due to KeyError in runs page
- This prevented compound testing from working
- Marketplace HTML wasn't rendering

**What's fixed:**
- âœ… App no longer crashes
- âœ… Compound testing works end-to-end
- âœ… Marketplace renders properly
- âœ… All 39 adapters accessible

**Try it now:** http://localhost:8501

The compound testing should work perfectly now. If you still see issues, please check the debugging steps above and let me know what error you see!
