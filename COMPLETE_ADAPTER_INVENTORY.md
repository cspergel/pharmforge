## TESTING PRIORITY MATRIX

### High Value + Likely Working = TEST FIRST
- ChEMBL (stable API, high value)
- PubChem (stable API, essential)
- RDKit Local (offline tool)
- PubMed (stable NCBI API)

### High Value + Needs Setup = TEST SECOND
- Vina (essential docking tool)
- AiZynthFinder (you have download scripts)
- ADMET-AI (ML predictions)

### Lower Priority
- Literature search (EuropePMC, Google Patents, Lens)
- Advanced ML (DiffDock, MolGAN, REINVENT)
- Specialized tools (OpenMM, De Novo)

## CURRENT STATUS METRICS

**Confirmed Working:** 12/33 (36%)
**Needs API Key Only:** 1/33 (3%)
**Needs Testing:** 20/33 (61%)

**Estimated Production Ready After Testing:** 20-25/33 (60-75%)

Would you like me to:
1. Test the "likely working" adapters in batch?
2. Set up and test the high-priority tools (Vina, AiZynthFinder)?
3. Create a comprehensive test plan for all 20 untested adapters?
4. Focus on specific categories (databases, ML tools, literature)?
