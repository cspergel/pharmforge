# OpenMM Adapter Requirements
#
# Installation Instructions:
# -------------------------
#
# RECOMMENDED (with conda - includes GPU support):
#   conda install -c conda-forge openmm
#   conda install -c conda-forge pdbfixer
#
# ALTERNATIVE (with pip - CPU only):
#   pip install openmm>=8.0.0
#   pip install pdbfixer>=1.9
#
# For GPU acceleration (CUDA):
#   - Install CUDA toolkit from NVIDIA
#   - OpenMM will automatically detect and use CUDA if available
#   - Performance improvement: 5-50x faster than CPU
#
# For OpenCL (alternative GPU):
#   - Install OpenCL drivers for your GPU
#   - OpenMM supports OpenCL for AMD and other GPUs

# Core dependencies
openmm>=8.0.0
pdbfixer>=1.9

# Already included in main PharmForge requirements:
# rdkit>=2023.9.5  # For SMILES to 3D conversion
# numpy>=1.26.4    # For numerical operations

# Optional for advanced force fields:
# openmmforcefields>=0.11.0  # GAFF, AMBER, etc.
# openmm-ml>=1.0  # Machine learning potentials
# openmmtools>=0.23.0  # Additional utilities
