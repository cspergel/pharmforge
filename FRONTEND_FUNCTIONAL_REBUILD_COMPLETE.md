## 🔧 To Make It Fully Functional (Connect to Real Backend)

### Option A: Quick Test with Mock Data (Works NOW)
```bash
# Just open http://localhost:8501
# Everything works with realistic mock data
# Perfect for testing UX flow
```

### Option B: Connect to Real Backend (Need to restart)
```bash
# 1. Restart backend to load new API routes
cd claude-code-agents-wizard-v2
docker-compose restart backend

# 2. Wait 30 seconds for backend to start

# 3. Test backend API
curl http://localhost:8000/api/adapters/list | jq

# 4. If successful, frontend will use real data
# Open http://localhost:8501
# New pages will call real API instead of mocks
```

- Benchmarks are example values

**Real Backend Connection:**
- Backend needs restart to load new API routes
- Some adapters may not have real implementations yet
- Execution times will be longer (2-30s per adapter)

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- LLM result summarization
- Molecule generation/design mode
- Compound library management
- Advanced pipeline builder
