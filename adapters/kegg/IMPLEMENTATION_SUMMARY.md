## API Endpoints Used

The adapter uses the following FREE KEGG REST API endpoints:

### Base URL
```
https://rest.kegg.jp
```

### Implemented Endpoints

1. **INFO** - `/info/<database>`
   - Get database information and statistics
   - Example: `/info/pathway`

2. **LIST** - `/list/<database>` or `/list/pathway/<org>`
   - List all entries in a database
   - Example: `/list/pathway/hsa` (human pathways)

3. **FIND** - `/find/<database>/<query>[/<option>]`
   - Search entries by keyword or chemical property
   - Examples:
     - `/find/compound/glucose`
     - `/find/compound/C6H12O6/formula`

4. **GET** - `/get/<entry_ids>[/<option>]`
   - Retrieve full entry details
   - Supports up to 10 entries
   - Example: `/get/C00031` (glucose)

5. **LINK** - `/link/<target_db>/<source>`
   - Cross-reference between databases
   - Examples:
     - `/link/pathway/hsa:7157` (pathways for TP53 gene)
     - `/link/pathway/C00031` (pathways for glucose)

6. **CONV** - `/conv/<target_db>/<source>`
   - Convert between ID systems
   - Example: `/conv/ncbi-geneid/hsa:7157`

## Core Functionality

### Query Methods

1. **query_pathway()**
   - Get specific pathway by ID
   - Search pathways by keyword
   - List pathways for organism

2. **query_gene()**
   - Get specific gene by ID
   - Search genes by keyword
   - List genes for organism
   - Returns associated pathways

3. **query_compound()**
   - Get specific compound by ID
   - Search compounds by name
   - Search by chemical formula
   - Returns associated pathways

4. **query_disease()**
   - Get specific disease by ID
   - Search diseases by keyword
   - Returns associated genes and pathways

5. **query_drug()**
   - Get specific drug by ID
   - Search drugs by keyword
   - Returns drug targets

### Auto-Detection

The adapter automatically detects query types based on ID format:
- **Gene IDs**: `org:number` (e.g., `hsa:7157`)
- **Compound IDs**: `C#####` (e.g., `C00031`)
- **Drug IDs**: `D#####` (e.g., `D00109`)
- **Disease IDs**: `H#####` (e.g., `H00056`)
- **Pathway IDs**: `org##### or map#####` (e.g., `hsa00010`)

### Helper Methods

- `_make_request()` - HTTP request wrapper with error handling
- `_get_info()` - Database information retrieval
- `_list_entries()` - List database entries
- `_find_entries()` - Search functionality
- `_get_entry()` - Entry retrieval
- `_link_databases()` - Cross-database linking
- `_convert_ids()` - ID conversion
- `_parse_flat_file()` - KEGG flat file parser

## Example Queries That Work

### 1. Pathway Queries
```python
# By ID
await adapter.execute({"operation": "query_pathway", "pathway_id": "hsa00010"})

# By search
await adapter.execute({"operation": "query_pathway", "search_term": "apoptosis"})

# By organism
await adapter.execute({"operation": "query_pathway", "organism": "hsa"})

# Auto-detect
await adapter.execute("hsa00010")
```

### 2. Gene Queries
```python
# By ID
await adapter.execute({"operation": "query_gene", "gene_id": "hsa:7157"})

# By search
await adapter.execute({"operation": "query_gene", "search_term": "insulin receptor"})

# Auto-detect
await adapter.execute("hsa:7157")
```

### 3. Compound Queries
```python
# By ID
await adapter.execute({"operation": "query_compound", "compound_id": "C00031"})

# By name
await adapter.execute({"operation": "query_compound", "search_term": "aspirin"})

# By formula
await adapter.execute({"operation": "query_compound", "formula": "C6H12O6"})

# Auto-detect
await adapter.execute("C00031")
```

### 4. Disease Queries
```python
# By ID
await adapter.execute({"operation": "query_disease", "disease_id": "H00056"})

# By search
await adapter.execute({"operation": "query_disease", "search_term": "cancer"})

# Auto-detect
await adapter.execute("H00056")
```

### 5. Drug Queries
```python
# By ID
await adapter.execute({"operation": "query_drug", "drug_id": "D00109"})

# By search
await adapter.execute({"operation": "query_drug", "search_term": "metformin"})

# Auto-detect
await adapter.execute("D00109")
```

## Test Results

### Test Suite Results
✅ All major test suites passed:
- Pathway queries: 3/3 tests passed
- Gene queries: 3/3 tests passed
- Compound queries: 4/4 tests passed
- Disease queries: 3/3 tests passed
- Drug queries: 3/3 tests passed (with expected warnings)
- Integration scenarios: 2/2 tests passed

### Example Queries Tested
- **Pathways**: 367 human pathways retrieved, search/ID queries working
- **Genes**: TP53 gene with 51 associated pathways retrieved
- **Compounds**: Glucose with 34 associated pathways retrieved
- **Diseases**: Alzheimer's disease data retrieved with pathway associations
- **Drugs**: Aspirin and other pharmaceutical compounds retrieved
- **Formula Search**: 50 compounds found for C6H12O6

### Performance
- Average response time: 0.5-2 seconds per query
- Rate limiting: 0.3 seconds between requests (configurable)
- Timeout: 30 seconds (configurable)
- Successful parsing of KEGG flat file format
- Robust error handling for invalid queries

## Limitations and Notes

### API Limitations
1. **Entry Limits**: Maximum 10 entries per GET request (KEGG API limitation)
2. **No Authentication**: Uses FREE public API (no API key required)
3. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in 0.3s delay to be respectful to free service
4. **Data Format**: Returns KEGG flat file format, parsed into dictionaries

### Expected Behaviors
1. **400 Errors for Some Links**: Not all database pairs can be linked (e.g., disease → genes may return 400). This is expected KEGG API behavior and is handled gracefully.
2. **Result Limits**: Some queries automatically limit results (e.g., 50-100 entries) to prevent overwhelming responses
3. **Organism-Specific Data**: Some operations require organism codes (e.g., gene/pathway queries)

### Known Issues
- Some link operations return 400 status codes for incompatible database pairs (documented and expected)
- Disease → genes links may not always be available
- Drug → target links may not always be available
- These are KEGG API limitations, not adapter issues

# Initialize
adapter = KEGGAdapter()

# Execute query
result = await adapter.execute(input_data, **kwargs)

# Check result
if result.success:
    data = result.data
else:
    error = result.error
```
