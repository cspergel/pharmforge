## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Optimization Strategy

#### Auto-sklearn: Bayesian Optimization
```
Uses SMAC3 (Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration)
- Builds a probabilistic model of hyperparameter performance
- Explores promising regions efficiently
- Less random exploration, more focused search
- Converges faster to good solutions
```

**Pros:**
- Faster convergence (often finds good models in 5-10 minutes)
- More efficient use of time budget
- Better for limited compute resources

**Cons:**
- May miss novel pipeline configurations
- Less diverse exploration of model space
- Can get stuck in local optima

#### TPOT: Genetic Programming
```
Evolves ML pipelines using genetic algorithms
- Treats pipelines as "organisms" that breed and mutate
- Explores diverse combinations of algorithms and preprocessors
- More random, broader search
- Requires more generations to converge
```

**Pros:**
- Discovers novel pipeline configurations
- Broader search of model space
- Better for finding unusual solutions
- More exploratory

**Cons:**
- Slower convergence (needs 20-50 generations)
- Less efficient time usage
- May need more compute resources

---

### 2. Meta-Learning

#### Auto-sklearn: Warm-Start from Past Runs
```python
# Auto-sklearn can leverage meta-features
# Automatically identifies similar problems from past runs
# Warm-starts with good initial configurations
```

**Example:**
```python
# First run on similar QSAR problem
input_data_1 = {
    "task": "regression",
    "X_train": ic50_descriptors_1,
    "y_train": ic50_values_1,
    "time_limit": 300
}
result_1 = await autosklearn(input_data_1)

# Second run benefits from meta-learning
# Auto-sklearn knows what worked before
input_data_2 = {
    "task": "regression",
    "X_train": ic50_descriptors_2,  # Similar features
    "y_train": ic50_values_2,
    "time_limit": 300
}
result_2 = await autosklearn(input_data_2)
# Often finds better models faster
```

**TPOT:** No meta-learning - starts fresh every time.

---

### 3. Output Format

#### Auto-sklearn: Weighted Ensemble
```python
# Returns multiple models with weights
{
    "ensemble": {
        "size": 50,
        "models": [
            {"weight": 0.45, "algorithm": "RandomForest"},
            {"weight": 0.30, "algorithm": "GradientBoosting"},
            {"weight": 0.15, "algorithm": "ExtraTrees"},
            {"weight": 0.10, "algorithm": "KNN"}
        ]
    }
}

# Predictions are weighted average of all models
# More robust, less overfitting
```

**Pros:**
- More robust predictions
- Lower variance
- Better generalization

**Cons:**
- Harder to interpret
- Larger model size
- Slower inference

#### TPOT: Single Optimized Pipeline
```python
# Returns one pipeline
# Full Python code export
{
    "pipeline_code": """
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('model', RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10))
])
    """
}
```

**Pros:**
- Clear, interpretable
- Easy to understand
- Smaller model size
- Faster inference

**Cons:**
- May overfit more
- Higher variance
- Single point of failure

## Ensemble Strategy: Use Both!

The **best approach** is to use both adapters and ensemble their predictions:

```python
from adapters.autosklearn import AutoSklearnAdapter
from adapters.tpot import TPOTAdapter

autosklearn = AutoSklearnAdapter()
tpot = TPOTAdapter()

# Prepare data
input_data = {
    "task": "regression",
    "X_train": molecular_descriptors,
    "y_train": pic50_values,
    "X_test": test_descriptors,
    "y_test": test_pic50
}

# Run Auto-sklearn (fast, Bayesian)
auto_input = {**input_data, "time_limit": 300}
auto_result = await autosklearn.execute(auto_input)

# Run TPOT (exploratory, genetic)
tpot_input = {**input_data, "generations": 20, "population_size": 50}
tpot_result = await tpot.execute(tpot_input)

# Ensemble predictions (weighted average)
auto_pred = auto_result.data['predictions']['test']
tpot_pred = tpot_result.data['predictions']['test']

# Weight by cross-validation performance
auto_score = auto_result.data['performance']['test_score']
tpot_score = tpot_result.data['performance']['test_score']

total_score = auto_score + tpot_score
auto_weight = auto_score / total_score
tpot_weight = tpot_score / total_score

final_pred = [
    auto_weight * a + tpot_weight * t
    for a, t in zip(auto_pred, tpot_pred)
]

# Often outperforms either individual method!
```

**Benefits:**
- Combines Bayesian efficiency with genetic exploration
- More robust than either method alone
- Reduces risk of local optima
- Better generalization

## When to Use Neither

Consider alternatives when:

1. **You need explainable AI**
   - Use interpretable models directly (linear, decision trees)
   - Manual feature engineering + simple models
   - SHAP/LIME for interpretation

2. **You have < 50 samples**
   - Too small for AutoML to find good hyperparameters
   - Use simple models with cross-validation
   - Consider transfer learning or semi-supervised approaches

3. **You need real-time predictions**
   - AutoML ensembles can be slow
   - Use lightweight models (logistic regression, shallow trees)
   - Consider model distillation

4. **You have deep learning problems**
   - Use specialized adapters (Chemprop, DeepChem)
   - AutoML is better for traditional ML
   - Consider AutoKeras for neural architecture search
