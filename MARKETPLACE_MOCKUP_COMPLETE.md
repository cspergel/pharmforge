registry.register_from_marketplace("pharmalab/egfr-docking-v2")

# Now available in PharmForge UI
```

### 2. Pipeline Builder Integration
Import complete workflows from marketplace:
```
New Run ‚Üí Import from Marketplace
‚Üí Search: "EGFR hit identification"
‚Üí Use Pipeline ‚Üí Auto-configures entire workflow
```

### 3. Dataset Integration
Use marketplace datasets in runs:
```python
dataset = marketplace_api.get_dataset("chembl/egfr-inhibitors")
for compound in dataset.iter_smiles():
    pipeline.run(compound)
```

### 4. Benchmark Submission
Auto-submit results to leaderboards:
```
Run Complete ‚úÖ

## Why This Matters (Long-Term Value)

### Network Effects
1. Researchers publish models ‚Üí Attract users
2. Users download models ‚Üí Attract more researchers
3. More content ‚Üí Higher platform value
4. Platform value ‚Üí Attract companies

### Competitive Moat
- Once researchers publish here, they keep coming back
- Community-driven content is hard to replicate
- Network effects = sustainable competitive advantage

### Business Model
- Freemium marketplace (free + paid tiers)
- Revenue share on paid items
- Enterprise accounts
- Potential for acquisition (like Hugging Face ‚Üí $200M+ funding)

---

## Competitive Differentiation

### vs. Hugging Face
‚úÖ Drug discovery-specific (not general ML)
‚úÖ Integrated with full platform (not just model hosting)
‚úÖ Standardized adapter protocol
‚úÖ Built-in benchmarking
‚úÖ One-click deployment

### vs. TorchDrug/TDC
‚úÖ Has marketplace (they don't)
‚úÖ More models available
‚úÖ Community-driven
‚úÖ Full platform integration

### vs. GitHub
‚úÖ Model-specific features
‚úÖ Benchmark leaderboards
